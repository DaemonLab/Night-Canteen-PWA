# Night-Canteen-PWA

## Description

**PWA**, Progressive Web App in simple words is a website that works as if it is a mobile app. Users can use it without downloading it from any app store.
We all are familiar with the working of night canteens and haved waited in long queues for ordering the food. The main aim of this PWA would be to automate the process of ordering by the students, paying for their food where the canteen owners can accept the orders saving a lot of time.

## Motivation

Ordering in night canteen has been quite a tedious task and many a times we don't even get a chance to order the food. The Night Canteen App focuses on easing this process giving everyone foodie a hastle free experience of ordering.

## Clients

There will be two types of users/groups that will have access to the application

1. Students and Faculties
   - Sign in to the app using **Google Auth** through their college emails only.
   - See the menu for the night canteen which can be **filtered**. (Eg. Veg/Non-Veg, etc.)
   - Selecting an item should automatically add it to the **cart**.
   - Pay using **UPI**.
   
2. Canteen Owner
   - Change the daily menu.
   - Accept/Reject Orders.

## Tech Stacks

These may change as time progresses but for now we have planned to use the following:

- ReactJS for frontend
- Sqlite for backend
- React OAuth2 for signing in users
